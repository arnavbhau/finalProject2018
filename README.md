# finalProject2018
For my final project for intro to programming, I've decided to make a basic mario bros game from scratch, using help from basic pygame tutorials as this is my first time programming a big project.

I started off by reviewing previous notes from the class, especially in the context of classes and the more advanced parts of the class. After that, I wanted to start the program with the background. I did research, and with the help of tutorials like the codepylet's, I was able to get a background working. With this, I of course had to start making some basic structure for my program as well as original basic things before actually starting. These included importing libraries, making a setup function, a pretty simple settings class, and so forth.

Now that I had my background, I changed my focus to blitting the background. This was one of my biggest challenges, and it took up a significant amount of time in terms of my project as a whole. I ultimately ended up following the code pylet in his tutorial, and finally got that to work. I actually started off with a background from the wii game, but I realized that that wasn't blittable and connected, so I opted for a more basic background in terms of just a ground brick layer.

After that, I went to work on the actual player class. Specifically, I made the original structure, and my next task was to get the player to actually show up on the screen. After experimentation and trying a bunch of things out, I finally got the player on the screen. After getting the player on, I started to expand the player class to include more, like more variables for getting the player to move.

I then tried to get the sound working for my game, and Diego actually showed me a pretty simple way he got his to work, so I implemented that way to include sound, by using a youtube to mp3 converter, getting a youtube video with the sound, converting that video to a file I could use, saving it to my project file, and calling it in my code.

Finally, my absolute biggest obstacle to overcome was getting the player to move / jump. This pretty much took up the rest of my time, as I tried implementing many different ways of going about the problem. Ultimately, I finally got the player to move, but not after a long long grueling process of troubleshooting and more.
